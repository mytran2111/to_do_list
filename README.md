# To Do List App 

This is my second front-end project, a to-do list app. The idea of the app is to recreate a similar app to Microsoft To Do. You can add new task using the text input area and also 
once you finish the task, you can move it to the completed area and you can hide all your finished tasks. If you make mistake, you can always go back and move it back to the To-do 
area again. 

For this website, I only use html, JavaScript and CSS for the 2D design. You can try it out [here](https://todo.mytran2111.repl.co/)
